# Frontend - DTI 

## What this implementation is about:
This is the frontend implementation for DTI exam. It is a web application that provides a way to manage users and their photos and albuns.

## How to start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Improvements
- Implement a better error handling system
- Implement redirects
- Implement screens for Photo and Album
- Implement a better layout
- Improve UX/UI
- Implement a better way to manage the state of the application (useContext, Redux, etc)

>[!CAUTION]
>I tried to develop the application as simple as possible, focusing on the functionalities requested. I didn't implement the screens for Photo and Album because I didn't have time to do it, i prefer to focus on Backend implementation.
